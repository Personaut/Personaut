# Setup & Installation

This guide will help you set up the Personaut development environment.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v16.x or higher
- **npm**: v8.x or higher (usually comes with Node.js)
- **VS Code**: Latest version recommended

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Personaut/Personaut.git
    cd Personaut
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Compile the extension**:
    ```bash
    npm run compile
    ```

## Running Locally

1.  Open the project in VS Code:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

2.  Press `F5` or verify that the "Run Extension" launch configuration is selected in the Run and Debug view.
3.  A new VS Code Host window will open with the extension loaded.

## Webview Development

The Personaut UI is built with React.

-   **Source**: `src/webview/`
-   **Build**: The webview is bundled by `esbuild` during the `npm run compile` step.
-   **Hot Reload**: Currently, you must reload the extension host (`Cmd+R` / `Ctrl+R`) to see changes in the webview.

## Troubleshooting

### Webview not loading
Ensure you have run `npm run compile` at least once. If the issue persists, check the Debug Console in the main VS Code window for errors.

### Dependency issues
If you encounter errors related to missing modules, try removing `node_modules` and re-installing:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
