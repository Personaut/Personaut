# Build Mode

An agentic mode where Personaut can actively write code to implement features.

## Overview
Build Mode transforms Personaut from a feedback tool into an active coding assistant. It uses advanced agentic capabilities to understand requirements, plan tasks, and execute file edits.

## Usage
1.  Switch to **Build** mode in the sidebar.
2.  Describe the feature you want to build (e.g., "Add a dark mode toggle to the header").
3.  The agent will:
    - Analyze the codebase.
    - Propose a plan.
    - Break it down into steps.
    - Execute commands and file edits.
4.  You can review each step or allow the agent to proceed automatically.
