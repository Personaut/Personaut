# Feedback Loop

Get simulated user feedback on your code or ideas from the perspective of your defined personas.

## Overview
The Feedback Loop allows you to test your application against your personas without needing real users available immediately.

## Usage
1.  Go to the **Feedback** tab.
2.  Select one or more Personas from your library.
3.  **Context**: Provide context for what you want feedback on.
    - **Text**: "Review this login function."
    - **URL**: Provide a localhost URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    - **Screenshot**: The extension can capture the current state of the URL.
4.  Click **Generate Feedback**.
5.  Review the responses. Each persona will respond in their unique voice.
